<!-- 
Do not forget to add a changelog when you have made admin/player facing changes that can alter gameplay.
Examples which require a changelog entry include:
* Adding/removing objects that players may interact with, or the way they function.
* Adding/removing/altering admin tools.
* Changing the map.

Examples were changelog entries are optional/not typically required:
* Cosmetic changes such as descriptions, sound effects, etc.
* Optimizations and other changes to underlying systems which do not affect gameplay.
* Minor bug fixes.

You'll find a README and example file in .\html\changelogs\ for further instructions.

You can also find a template for adding your changelog directly to the PR description here: https://github.com/Baystation12/Baystation12/wiki/Automatic-changelog-generation

<!-- Both :cl:'s are required for the changelog to work! You can put your name to the right of the first :cl: if you want to overwrite your GitHub username as author ingame. -->
<!-- You can use multiple of the same prefix (they're only used for the icon ingame) and delete the unneeded ones. Despite some of the tags, changelogs should generally represent how a player might be affected by the changes rather than a summary of the PR's contents. -->
